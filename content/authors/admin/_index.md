Hi there. I am a research assistant at the Hopkins Computational Imaging Group. My research interests include
Machine Learning, Optimization and Imaging. Now I am working on image reconstruction optimization under Professor Yu Sun.

I recently graduated from University of Wisconsin - Madison with MS in Statistics and Data Science. I interned in MLOptic 
as a junior software Engineer. And I came back as an intern this summer working on Machine Leaning tools for image defect detections.

My earlier background as an undergraduate was in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics. I conducted my initial research experience 
under Professor Yaping Wu on biological diffusion model and Professor Hengjian, Cui on Mathematical Analysis.
